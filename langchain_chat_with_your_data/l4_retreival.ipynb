Louder? Actually, could you turn up the volume? Testing. Is this better? \\nTesting, testing. Okay, cool. Thanks.   So all right, online resources. The class has a home page, so it's in on the handouts. I \\nwon't write on the chalkboard — http:// cs229.stanford.edu. And so when there are \\nhomework assignments or things like that, we  usually won't sort of — in the mission of \\nsaving trees, we will usually not give out many handouts in class. So homework \\nassignments, homework solutions will be posted online at the course home page.  \\nAs far as this class, I've also written, a nd I guess I've also revised every year a set of \\nfairly detailed lecture notes that cover the te chnical content of this  class. And so if you \\nvisit the course homepage, you'll also find the detailed lecture notes that go over in detail \\nall the math and equations and so on  that I'll be doing in class.  \\nThere's also a newsgroup, su.class.cs229, also written on the handout. This is a \\nnewsgroup that's sort of a forum for people in  the class to get to  know each other and \\nhave whatever discussions you want to ha ve amongst yourselves. So the class newsgroup \\nwill not be monitored by the TAs and me. But this is a place for you to form study groups \\nor find project partners or discuss homework problems and so on, and it's not monitored\")"

Oh, okay, much smaller number.  \\nSo as part of this class, especially in the homeworks, we'll ask you to implement a few \\nprograms, a few machine learning algorithms as  part of the homeworks.

And it's sort of an extremely easy to  learn tool to use for implementing a lot of \\nlearning algorithms.  \\nAnd in case some of you want to work on your  own home computer or something if you \\ndon't have a MATLAB license, for the purposes of  this class, there's also — [inaudible]\")"
